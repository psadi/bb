### Points to Ponder

* This utility is tested with bitbucket enterprise version 6.10.10
* I have personally tested it in Linux, Windows(Powershell and Command Prompt), MacOS and GIT Bash and it works flawlessly
* In case if your ID gets locked the token wont work, you may need to reset your ID (Token can remain the same)
* At times if there are frequent account lockouts, Bitbucket will prompt you to enter CAPTCHA, you may need to relogin with CAPTCHA validation in your broswer once else connection will fail

### üí° TIP

* Use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) for better visual rendering
* Use Nerd font for better font/icon support, I personally use [DroidSansMono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/DroidSansMono.zip)
  * [Preview Font](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#droid-sans)

[bbcli](https://github.com/psadi/bbcli) wouldn't be possible if not for the awesome open-source tools made avaiable.
